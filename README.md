# -Prediction-of-Employee-Absenteeism-at-work

Skills used are Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLEARN and Keras)

The Employee's Absence at Work is predicted by considering data from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.

Distinct machine learning models Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision trees, and Deep Neural Networks are created for the best performance analysis in Python to get the best accuracy score.

This project gives insights into Human Resources(HR) Analytics where the employee's absence can be validated using various reasons which can potentially impact the weightage for the decision-making process for promotion and termination of an employee at the organization.
